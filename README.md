# Calculator-JS
GI-Week 6

Summary:

This calculator is designed to accept equations either through button clicks or by keyboard input. I used many functions to run through conditionals as well as event listners depending on the button or key clicked.

Error Handling: 
If the user inputs more than or equal to 19 numbers/operators, the calculate function will return an error message.

What I would work on if I had more time: adding an error message it 2 operators were used. Was not able to figure that out.
